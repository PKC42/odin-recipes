# odin-recipies

This is the first project as found in the foundations secton of the Odin project as of 08/22/2022. This project is an HTML project where a home page is made with links
to other pages which contain recipes. This project has an images folder which contains the images used along with the recipes folder which contains the recipes for each of the items. Each recipe is derived from r/StupidFood and gives the hypothetical instructions as to how to make them. This is my first HTML project. It is rough
and rushed but in the end, I think I managed to apply several concepts learned in previous lessons sucessfully.
